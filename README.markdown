# fireplace.vim

There's a REPL in fireplace, but you probably wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't
told you.  Such is the way with fireplace.vim.  By the way, this plugin is for
Clojure.

## Installation

First, set up [cider-nrepl][].  (If you skip this step, fireplace.vim will
make do with eval, which mostly works.) Next, fireplace.vim doesn't provide
indenting or syntax highlighting, so you'll want [a set of Clojure runtime
files](https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static) if you're on a version of
Vim earlier than 7.4.  You might also want [salve.vim][] for assorted
static project support.

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help fireplace`.

## Features

This list isn't exhaustive; see the `:help` for details.

### Transparent setup

Fireplace.vim talks to nREPL.  With Leiningen and Boot, it connects
automatically using the `.nrepl-port` file created when you run `lein repl` or
`boot repl`. If you are starting nREPL some other way, run `:Connect` and enter
the host and port.  You can connect to multiple instances of nREPL for different
projects, and it will use the right one automatically.  ClojureScript support is
just as seamless with [Piggieback][].

The only external dependency is that you have either a Vim with Python support
compiled in, or `python` in your path.

Oh, and if you don't have an nREPL connection, installing [salve.vim][]
lets it fall back to using `java clojure.main` for some of the basics, using a
class path based on your Leiningen config.  It's a bit slow, but a two-second
delay is vastly preferable to being forced out of my flow for a single
command, in my book.

### Not quite a REPL

You know that one plugin that provides a REPL in a split window and works
absolutely flawlessly, never breaking just because you did something innocuous
like backspace through part of the prompt?  No?  Such a shame, you really
would have liked it.

I've taken a different approach in fireplace.vim.  `cq`  (Think "Clojure
Quasi-REPL") is the prefix for a set of commands that bring up a *command-line
window* — the same thing you get when you hit `q:` — but set up for Clojure
code.

`cqq` prepopulates the command-line window with the expression under the
cursor.  `cqc` gives you a blank line in insert mode.

### Evaluating from the buffer

Standard stuff here.  `:Eval` evaluates a range (`:%Eval` gets the whole
file), `:Require` requires a namespace with `:reload` (`:Require!` does
`:reload-all`), either the current buffer or a given argument.  `:RunTests`
kicks off `(clojure.test/run-tests)` and loads the results into the quickfix
list.

There's a `cp` operator that evaluates a given motion (`cpp` for the
innermost form under the cursor). `cm` and `c1m` are similar, but they only
run `clojure.walk/macroexpand-all` and `macroexpand-1` instead of evaluating
the form entirely.

Any failed evaluation loads the stack trace into the location list, which
can be easily accessed with `:lopen`.

### Navigating and Comprehending

I was brand new to Clojure when I started this plugin, so stuff that helped me
understand code was a top priority.

* `:Source`, `:Doc`, and `:FindDoc`, which map to the underlying
  `clojure.repl` macro (with tab complete, of course).

* `K` is mapped to look up the symbol under the cursor with `doc`.

* `[d` is mapped to look up the symbol under the cursor with `source`.

* `[<C-D>` jumps to the definition of a symbol (even if it's inside a jar
  file).

* `gf`, everybody's favorite "go to file" command, works on namespaces.

Where possible, I favor enhancing built-ins over inventing a bunch of
`<Leader>` maps.

### Omnicomplete

Because why not?  It works in the quasi-REPL too.

## FAQ

> Why does it take so long for Vim to startup?

That's either [classpath.vim][] or [salve.vim][].
