# fireplace.vim

There's a REPL in fireplace, but you probably wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't
told you.  Such is the way with fireplace.vim.  By the way, this plugin is for
Clojure.

Fireplace.vim used to be called foreplay.vim, but it was renamed so Java
developers wouldn't have to speak in hushed tones.

## Installation

Fireplace.vim doesn't provide indenting or syntax highlighting, so you'll want
[a set of Clojure runtime files](https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static).
You might also want [classpath.vim][] to run code when no REPL is available.

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace.git
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-classpath.git
    git clone git://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help fireplace`.

## Features

This list isn't exhaustive; see the `:help` for details.

### Transparent setup

Fireplace.vim talks to nREPL.  With Leiningen, it connects automatically based
on `target/repl-port`, otherwise it's just a `:Connect` away.  You can connect
to multiple instances of nREPL for different projects, and it will use the
right one automatically.

The only external dependency is that you have either a Vim with Python support
compiled in, or `ruby` in your path. (Don't ask.)

Oh, and if you don't have an nREPL connection, installing [classpath.vim][]
lets it fall back to using `java clojure.main`, using a class path based on
your Leiningen or Maven config.  It's a bit slow, but a two-second delay is
vastly preferable to being forced out of my flow for a single command, in my
book.

### Not quite a REPL

You know that one plugin that provides a REPL in a split window and works
absolutely flawlessly, never breaking just because you did something innocuous
like backspace through part of the prompt?  No?  Such a shame, you really
would have liked it.

I've taken a different approach in fireplace.vim.  `cq`  (Think "Clojure
Quasi-REPL") is the prefix for a set of commands that bring up a *command-line
window* — the same thing you get when you hit `q:` — but set up for Clojure
code.

`cqq` prepopulates the command-line window with the expression under the
cursor.  `cqc` gives you a blank line in insert mode.

### Evaluating from the buffer

Standard stuff here.  `:Eval` evaluates a range (`:%Eval` gets the whole
file), `:Require` requires a namespace with `:reload` (`:Require!` does
`:reload-all`), either the current buffer or a given argument.  There's a `cp`
operator that evaluates a given motion (`cpp` for the expression under the
cursor). `cm` and `c1m` are similar, but they only run
`clojure.walk/macroexpand-all` and `macroexpand-1` instead of evaluating the
form entirely.

Any failed evaluation loads the stack trace into the location list, which
can be easily accessed with `:lopen`.

### Navigating and Comprehending

I'm new to Clojure, so stuff that helps me understand code is a top priority.

* `:Source`, `:Doc`, `:FindDoc`, and `:Apropos`, which map to the underlying
  `clojure.repl` macro (with tab complete, of course).

* `K` is mapped to look up the symbol under the cursor with `doc`.

* `[d` is mapped to look up the symbol under the cursor with `source`.

* `[<C-D>` jumps to the definition of a symbol (even if it's inside a jar
  file).

* `gf`, everybody's favorite "go to file" command, works on namespaces.

Where possible, I favor enhancing built-ins over inventing a bunch of
`<Leader>` maps.

### Omnicomplete

Because why not?  It works in the quasi-REPL too.

## FAQ

> Why does it take so long for Vim to startup?

See the [classpath.vim FAQ][].  You can uninstall classpath.vim if you only
care about nREPL support.

## Contributing

More than any other plugin, I'm in over my head here.  I tried to do my
homework, but you don't learn best practices overnight.  Please, open
[GitHub issues][] for bug reports and feature requests.  Even better than a
feature request is just to tell me the pain you're experiencing, and perhaps
some ideas for what might eliminate it.  I know Vimscript; you know Clojure.
Let's synergize.

I'm a stickler for [commit messages][], so if you send me a pull
request with so much as superfluous period in the subject line, I will
reject it, then TP your house.
