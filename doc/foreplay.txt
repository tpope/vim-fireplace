*foreplay.txt*  Clojure REPL tease

Author:  Tim Pope <http://tpo.pe/>
License: Same terms as Vim itself (see |license|)

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

You need Clojure runtime files to use this plugin.  Try VimClojure.  You don't
need the interactive stuff.

CLASSPATH                                       *foreplay-classpath*

Upon loading a Clojure buffer, the 'path' option is automatically set to your
class path.  The class path is found by `lein classpath`, `mvn
dependency:build-classpath`, or failing both of those, $CLASSPATH.

This behavior is going away soon.  Install classpath.vim if you'd like to keep
it.

LEININGEN                                       *foreplay-leiningen*

Leiningen support is currently bare bones.  If a Leiningen project is found,
'makeprg' will be set to "lein".

Leiningen 2.x writes to target/repl-port when `lein repl` is invoked.  If this
file is found, an nREPL connection will be established automatically.

CONNECTING TO A REPL                            *foreplay-connect*

                                                *foreplay-:Connect*
:Connect {proto}://{host}:{port} {path}
                        Connect to a REPL server.  The path is the root of the
                        project that the REPL applies to.

:Connect                Interactively prompt for the options to connect to a
                        REPL server.

The REPL is used for the commands below. If no REPL is found for the current
buffer and classpath.vim is installed, java (or $JAVA_CMD) is invoked
directly, which can be quite slow depending on your setup.

The only adapter shipped with foreplay.vim is for nREPL.  You need Ruby
installed and either |if_pyth| or the ruby command in your PATH.
(This curious combination is an accident of history.)

DOCUMENTATION                                   *foreplay-documentation*

                                                *foreplay-:Doc*
:Doc {symbol}           Show the docs for the given symbol.

                                                *foreplay-:Javadoc*
:Javadoc {class}        Open the java docs for the given class in a browser.

                                                *foreplay-K*
K                       Look up docs for keyword under cursor.

                                                *foreplay-:FindDoc*
:FindDoc {arg}          Wrapper around (clojure.repl/find-doc ...).

                                                *foreplay-:Apropos*
:Apropos {arg}          Wrapper around (clojure.repl/apropos ...).

                                                *foreplay-:Source*
:Source {symbol}        Show the source for the given symbol.

                                                *foreplay-[d*
[d                      Show source for keyword under cursor.
]d

NAVIGATING                                      *foreplay-navigating*

These commands will never use a remote REPL, only a local one, as file paths
on a remote server wouldn't be very useful locally.

                                                *foreplay-[_CTRL-D*
[<C-D>                  Jump to the source of the keyword under the cursor.
]<C-D>

                                                *foreplay-CTRL-W_CTRL-D*
<C-W><C-D>              Jump to the source of the keyword under the cursor in
<C-W>d                  a split.

                                                *foreplay-gf*
gf                      Go to the file for the namespace under the cursor.

                                                *foreplay-:Djump*
:Djump {symbol}         Jump to the definition for the given symbol.

                                                *foreplay-:Dsplit*
:Dsplit {symbol}        Jump to the definition for the given symbol in a
                        split.

                                                *foreplay-:A*
:A                      In a test file, edit the implementation, and vice
                        versa.  Basically adds or removes -test from the end
                        of the current namespace and searches for it in the
                        class path.

                                                *foreplay-:AS*
:AS                     Like :A, but in a split.

                                                *foreplay-:AV*
:AV                     Like :A, but in a vertical split.

                                                *foreplay-:AT*
:AT                     Like :A, but in a tab.

EVALUATING CODE                                 *foreplay-eval*

All code is evaluated in the namespace of the current file, requiring it if
necessary.  If the current file sits outside the class path (project.clj, for
example), the user namespace is used instead.  If an exception occurs, the
stack trace is loaded into the |location-list|.  Use |:lopen| to view it.

                                                *foreplay-:Require*
:Require [ns]           Require :reload the given/current namespace.

                                                *foreplay-:Require!*
:Require! [ns]          Require :reload-all the given/current namespace.

                                                *foreplay-:Eval*
:Eval                   Eval/print the outermost expression for the current
                        line.

:{range}Eval            Eval/print the given range.

:Eval {expr}            Eval/print the given expression.

                                                *foreplay-:Eval!*
:[range]Eval!           Eval the given range or outermost expression and
                        replace it with its result.

:[range]Eval! {expr}    Eval the given expression and insert it after
                        the given range or current line.

                                                *foreplay-cp*
cp{motion}              Eval/print the code indicated by {motion}.

cpp                     Eval/print the inner-most expr at the cursor.

                                                *foreplay-cpr*
cpr                     Eval a require :reload form.

                                                *foreplay-cpR*
cpR                     Eval a require :reload-all form.

                                                *foreplay-c!*
c!{motion}              Eval/replace the code indicated by {motion}.

c!!                     Eval/replace the inner-most expr at the cusror.

                                                *foreplay-cqp*
cqp                     Bring up a prompt for code to eval/print.

                                                *foreplay-cqc*
cqc                     Bring up a |command-line-window| for code to
                        eval/print.  Equivalent to cqp<C-F>i.

                                                *foreplay-cq*
cq{motion}              Bring up a |command-line-window| with text indicated
                        by {motion} prepopulated.

                                                *foreplay-:Last*
:Last                   Open the result of the last evaluation in the preview
                        window.  Use :2Last to get the next-to-last result,
                        and so on.  Once the window is open, cycle to older
                        and newer entries with |:lprevious| and |:lnext|.

And insert mode:

                                                *foreplay-i_CTRL-R_(*
<C-R>(                  Evaluate the given expression and insert the result.

There's omnicomplete on |CTRL-X_CTRL-O|, which works in Clojure buffers and
in the |command-line-window|, and tab complete at the cqp prompt.
