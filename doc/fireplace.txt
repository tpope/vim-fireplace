                                                *fireplace*
While not a hard dependency of Fireplace itself, many features require
<https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl> for full functionality.

CONNECTING TO A REPL                            *fireplace-connect*

Connecting to lein repl happens automatically.  If you have a different setup,
you can connect by hand.

                                                *fireplace-:Connect*
:Connect nrepl://{host}:{port} [path]
:Connect {port} [path]
                        Connect to a REPL server.  The path is the root of the
                        project that the REPL applies to (try ".").

The REPL is used for the commands below. If no REPL is found for the current
buffer and 'path' contains at least one jar file, java (or $JAVA_CMD) is
invoked directly, which can be quite slow depending on your setup.

The only adapter shipped with fireplace.vim is for nREPL.  You need either
`python` or `python3` in your path.

                        *fireplace-piggieback* *fireplace-clojurescript*
ClojureScript can be evaled with Piggieback if the appropriate nREPL
middleware is loaded: https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback.  Be aware that your
ClojureScript files must be available on the classpath for this to work
properly, and that not all operations are supported.

                                                *fireplace-:Piggieback*
:Piggieback ({ns}/repl-env [...])
                        Create a new nREPL session and invoke
                        cider.piggieback/cljs-repl with the given environment.

:Piggieback ({ns}/cljs-repl [...])
                        If the argument is a call to a function not named
                        repl-env, it is invoked directly, without
                        cider.piggieback/cljs-repl.  This is useful for
                        (figwheel.main.api/cljs-repl) and similar functions.

:Piggieback {port}      If the argument looks like a port number,
                        weasel.repl.websocket (if available) or
                        cljs.repl.browser will be used to provide the REPL
                        environment.

:Piggieback             If no argument is given, :Piggieback defaults to
                        the ClojureScript environment specified in
                        *b:fireplace_cljs_repl* or *g:fireplace_cljs_repl* .
                        If projectionist.vim is installed, the "cljsRepl"
                        projectionist key is also checked.  This default will
                        be invoked automatically on first eval in a
                        ClojureScript buffer if :Piggieback is not invoked
                        explicitly.  To restore the old behavior of defaulting
                        to Nashorn, add this line to your vimrc:
>
        let g:fireplace_cljs_repl =
              \ '(cider.piggieback/cljs-repl (cljs.repl.nashorn/repl-env))'
<
:Piggieback!            Terminate the most recently created piggieback
                        session.

                                                *fireplace-:Doc*

                                                *fireplace-K*
K                       Look up the doc, javadoc, or spec-form for the
                        identifier under the cursor.

                                                *fireplace-:FindDoc*
:FindDoc {arg}          Wrapper around (clojure.repl/find-doc ...).

                                                *fireplace-:SpecForm*
:SpecForm {keyword}     Show the form of the spec given.
                        Like (spec/form keyword).

[d                      Show source for symbol under cursor.
]d

NAVIGATING                                      *fireplace-navigating*

These commands will never use a remote REPL, only a local one, as file paths
on a remote server wouldn't be very useful locally.

                                                *fireplace-[_CTRL-D*
[<C-D>                  Jump to the source of the symbol under the cursor.

                        split.

EVALUATING CODE                                 *fireplace-eval*

All code is evaluated in the namespace of the current file, requiring it if
necessary.  If the current file sits outside the class path (project.clj, for
example), the user namespace is used instead.

                                                *fireplace-:Require*

:[range]RunTests        Call clojure.test/test-var on the var defined at or
                        above the specified line and load the results into the
                        quickfix list.  Typically invoked as :.RunTests to run
                        the test under the cursor.

                        at the cursor prepopulated.

                                                *fireplace-cqc*
cqc                     Bring up a |command-line-window| for code to
                        eval/print.  Equivalent to cqp<C-F>i.

                        and so on.  Once the window is open, cycle to older
                        and newer entries with |:lprevious| and |:lnext|.

                                                *fireplace-:Stacktrace*
:Stacktrace             Retrieve the most recent Clojure error and load the
                        stacktrace into the quickfix list.

And insert mode:

                                                *fireplace-i_CTRL-R_(*
<C-R>(                  Evaluate the given expression and insert the result.

There's omnicomplete on |CTRL-X_CTRL-O|, which works in Clojure buffers and
in the |command-line-window|, and tab complete at the cqp prompt.
