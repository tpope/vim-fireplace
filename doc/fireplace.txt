This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

                                                *fireplace*
While not strictly necessary, this plugin works best with the middleware
provided by <https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl>.

CONNECTING TO A REPL                            *fireplace-connect*

Connecting to lein repl happens automatically.  If you have a different setup,
you can connect by hand.

                                                *fireplace-:Connect*
:Connect {proto}://{host}:{port} {path}
                        Connect to a REPL server.  The path is the root of the
                        project that the REPL applies to.

:Connect                Interactively prompt for the options to connect to a
                        REPL server.

The REPL is used for the commands below. If no REPL is found for the current
buffer and 'path' contains at least one jar file, java (or $JAVA_CMD) is
invoked directly, which can be quite slow depending on your setup.

The only adapter shipped with fireplace.vim is for nREPL.  You need either
|if_pyth| or the python command in your PATH.

                        *fireplace-piggieback* *fireplace-clojurescript*
ClojureScript can be evaled with Piggieback if the appropriate nREPL
middleware is loaded: https://github.com/cemerick/piggieback.  Be aware that
your ClojureScript files must be available on the classpath for this to work
properly, and that not all operations are supported.

                                                *fireplace-:Piggieback*
:Piggieback [{env}]     Create a new nREPL session and invoke
                        cemerick.piggieback/cljs-repl with the given or
                        default (Rhino) environment.  This will also happen
                        automatically on first eval in a ClojureScript buffer
                        if not invoked explicitly. If {env} is a number, the
                        piggieback repl-env will will use a cljs.repl.browser
                        (rather than a Rhino) env with the port set to the
                        number provided.

:Piggieback!            Terminate the most recently created piggieback
                        session.

DOCUMENTATION                                   *fireplace-documentation*

                                                *fireplace-:Doc*
:Doc {symbol}           Show the docs for the given symbol.

                                                *fireplace-:Javadoc*
:Javadoc {class}        Open the java docs for the given class in a browser.

                                                *fireplace-K*
K                       Look up docs for symbol under cursor.

                                                *fireplace-:FindDoc*
:FindDoc {arg}          Wrapper around (clojure.repl/find-doc ...).

                                                *fireplace-:Source*
:Source {symbol}        Show the source for the given symbol.

                                                *fireplace-[d*
[d                      Show source for symbol under cursor.
]d

NAVIGATING                                      *fireplace-navigating*

These commands will never use a remote REPL, only a local one, as file paths
on a remote server wouldn't be very useful locally.

                                                *fireplace-[_CTRL-D*
[<C-D>                  Jump to the source of the symbol under the cursor.
]<C-D>

                                                *fireplace-CTRL-W_CTRL-D*
<C-W><C-D>              Jump to the source of the symbol under the cursor in
<C-W>d                  a split.

                                                *fireplace-gf*
gf                      Go to the file for the namespace under the cursor.

                                                *fireplace-:Djump*
:Djump {symbol}         Jump to the definition for the given symbol.

                                                *fireplace-:Dsplit*
:Dsplit {symbol}        Jump to the definition for the given symbol in a
                        split.

EVALUATING CODE                                 *fireplace-eval*

All code is evaluated in the namespace of the current file, requiring it if
necessary.  If the current file sits outside the class path (project.clj, for
example), the user namespace is used instead.  If an exception occurs, the
stack trace is loaded into the |location-list|.  Use |:lopen| to view it.

                                                *fireplace-:Require*
:Require [ns]           Require :reload the given/current namespace.

                                                *fireplace-:Require!*
:Require! [ns]          Require :reload-all the given/current namespace.

                        the given range or current line.

                        the test under the cursor.

:0RunTests [pattern]    Call clojure.test/run-all-tests with the given pattern
                        and load the results into the quickfix list.

                                                *fireplace-cqq*
cqq                     Bring up a |command-line-window| with innermost form
                        at the cursor prepopulated.

                                                *fireplace-cqc*
cqc                     Bring up a |command-line-window| for code to
                        eval/print.  Equivalent to cqp<C-F>i.

                                                *fireplace-cq*
cq{motion}              Bring up a |command-line-window| with text indicated
                        by {motion} prepopulated.

                                                *fireplace-:Last*
:Last                   Open the result of the last evaluation in the preview
                        window.  Use :2Last to get the next-to-last result,
                        and so on.  Once the window is open, cycle to older
                        and newer entries with |:lprevious| and |:lnext|.

And insert mode:

                                                *fireplace-i_CTRL-R_(*
<C-R>(                  Evaluate the given expression and insert the result.

There's omnicomplete on |CTRL-X_CTRL-O|, which works in Clojure buffers and
in the |command-line-window|, and tab complete at the cqp prompt.
